    """Optimise hrf from a selection of voxels.

    This uses an iterative fitting optimisation procedure,
    where we fit for betas and then fit for hrf using a fir
    like approach.

    Args:
        design (pandas dataframe): this is a pandas data frame with keys:
            ['trial_type']: stimulus condition index
            ['onset']: onsets in s for each event
            ['duration']: duration for each event
        data (2d array): data (time x vox). this data should already
            have polynomials projected out.
        tr (float): the sampling rate in seconds
        hrfknobs (1d array): should be time x 1 with the initial seed
            for the HRF.  The length of this vector indicates the
            number of time points that we will attempt to estimate
            in the HRF. Note on normalization: after fitting the HRF, we
            normalize the HRF to peak at 1 (and adjust amplitudes
            accordingly).
        combinedmatrix (stack of 2d arrays): projection matrix of the
                polynomials and extra regressors (if passed by user).
                This is used to whiten the design matrix.
        numforhrf (int, optional): Defaults to 50.
                is a positive integer indicating the number of voxels
                (with the best R^2 values) to consider in fitting the
                global HRF.  (If there are fewer than that number of
                voxels available, we just use the voxels that are
                available.)
        hrfthresh (float, optional): Defaults to .5.
                If the R^2 between the estimated HRF and the initial HRF
                is less than <hrfthresh>, we decide to just use the initial
                HRF. Set <hrfthresh> to -Inf if you never want to reject
                the estimated HRF.

    Returns:
        (Dict): we return a dictionary with kers:
            ["hrf"]: the optimised hrf (but see note above on hrfthresh)
            ["hrffitvoxels"]: the indices of the voxels used to fit.
            ["convdesign"]: the design convolved with the optimised hrf
            and polynomials projected out.
            ["seedhrf"]: we return the seed hrf for book keeping.
