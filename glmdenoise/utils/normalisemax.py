f = normalisemax(m,dim)

 <m> is a matrix
 <dim> (optional) is the dimension of <m> to operate upon.
   default to 2 if <m> is a row vector and to 1 otherwise.
   special case is 0 which means operate globally.

 divide <m> by the max value along some dimension (or globally).

 example:
 (normalisemax([[1, 2, 3]])==[[1/3, 2/3, 1]]).all()
