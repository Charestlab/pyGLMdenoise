    """Fits a least square of combined runs.

    The matrix addition is equivalent to concatenating the list of data and
    the list of design and fit it all at once. However, this is more memory
    efficient.

    Arguments:
        runs {list} -- List of runs. Each run is an TR x voxel sized array
        design {list} -- List of design matrices. Each design matrix
                        is an TR x predictor sized array

    Returns:
        [array] -- betas from fit
